# Health Insurance SQL Analysis
This project demonstrates an analysis of health insurance data using SQL.  
The dataset was imported into Microsoft SQL Server and analyzed to uncover key insights such as cost patterns, demographic distributions, and the impact of lifestyle factors on insurance charges.

# Dataset Overview
- Database: Health Analytics  
- Table: dbo.insurance  
- columns:
  age` – Age of policyholder
  `sex` – Gender
  `bmi` – Body Mass Index
  'children` – Number of children/dependents
  `smoker` – Smoker status (yes/no)
  `region` – Residential area
  `charges` – Medical insurance costs

# SQL Highlights
- Average insurance charges by smoker status & region  
- Highest insurance charges  
- Age vs. Charges analysis  
- Gender & children distribution
  
# Example Insight
